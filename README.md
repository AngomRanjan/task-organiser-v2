# Task Organiser v2

> This is the react version of Angom's Task Organiser.

## Features

- **Task Manager**: ......
- **Customizable Options**: Toggle the inclusion of numbers and special characters to enhance password complexity.
- **Real-time Preview**: View the generated password in real-time as options are adjusted.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Quickly copy the generated password with a single click for easy use.

## Learning Curve

This project provided an excellent opportunity to improve my understanding of several key concepts:

- **React Hooks**: Enhanced proficiency with React hooks, particularly in handling state and side effects across components.
- **Custom Hooks (`usePassword`)**: Developed a custom hook, `usePassword`, to encapsulate the logic for generating and managing password-related state, promoting code reuse and modularity.
- **Utility Functions (`generatePassword`)**: Created a utility function, `generatePassword`, to handle the logic of generating a password based on specific criteria, which was an exercise in writing clean, reusable code.
- **Context API**: Leveraged the Context API to share global state across the application, making it easier to manage complex state.
- **useMemo**: Used `useMemo` to optimize performance by memoizing the password generation, ensuring it only recalculates when the relevant inputs change.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Applied Tailwind CSS for efficient and responsive styling.
- **Code Organization**: Followed best practices for organizing code, including using the duck pattern, to improve maintainability and readability.

## Built With

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **JavaScript**: The programming language used to build the core logic.
